## This evening's goals

-   Me being exposed to questions
-   You learning at least something new

---

## What we've done so far

-   Deep dive into the expression language
-   Introduction to flakes

---

## Schedule

1. Introduction to derivations
2. The `mkDerivation` function
3. Creating your own derivation
4. Higher level derivation functions
5. Building a Python package

---

## Nix derivations

https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.25/language/derivations

---

## What is a derivation?

[...] a specification [...] to repeatably produce output files at uniquely determined file system paths.

---

## What's the structure of a derivation

```nix
{
  "/nix/store/<cryptographic hash>-<name>.drv": {
    "outputs": {
      "out": {
        "path": "/nix/store/<cryptographic hash>-<name>"
      }
    },
    "inputSrcs": [ <paths of input sources> ],
    "inputDrvs": {},
    "platform": "<platform>",
    "builder": "<path/to/builder>",
    "args": [],
    "env": {
      "builder": "mybuilder",
      "name": "myname",
      "out": "/nix/store/40s0qmrfb45vlh6610rk29ym318dswdr-myname",
      "system": "mysystem"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Nix Pill on derivations

For a deeper dive:

https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/06-our-first-derivation.html

---

## Defining your first derivation

```nix
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "<derivation-name>";
  version = "<semver>";
  src = ./path/to/files;
  buildPhase = ''
    # <commands>
  '';
  installPhase = ''
    # <commands>
  '';
}
```

---

`mkDerivation` is very adaptable

https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#part-stdenv

...but this can become cumbersome!

---

```nix
stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
  pname = "solo5";
  version = "0.7.5";

  src = fetchurl {
    url = "https://github.com/Solo5/solo5/releases/download/v${version}/solo5-v${version}.tar.gz";
    hash = "sha256-viwrS9lnaU8sTGuzK/+L/PlMM/xRRtgVuK5pixVeDEw=";
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = [
    makeWrapper
    pkg-config
  ];

  buildInputs = [ libseccomp ];

  postInstall = ''
    substituteInPlace $out/bin/solo5-virtio-mkimage \
      --replace-fail "/usr/lib/syslinux" "${syslinux}/share/syslinux" \
      --replace-fail "/usr/share/syslinux" "${syslinux}/share/syslinux" \
      --replace-fail "cp " "cp --no-preserve=mode "

    wrapProgram $out/bin/solo5-virtio-mkimage \
      --prefix PATH : ${
        lib.makeBinPath [
          dosfstools
          mtools
          parted
          syslinux
        ]
      }
  '';

  doCheck = true;
  nativeCheckInputs = [
    util-linux
    qemu
  ];
  checkPhase = ''[elided]'';
}
```

---

## Higher level derivation functions

Nix comes with

[buildGoModule](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#ssec-language-go),
[buildNpmPackage](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#javascript-buildNpmPackage),
[buildPythonPackage](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#buildpythonpackage-function),
[buildRustPackage](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#compiling-rust-applications-with-cargo),

and [many more](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-language-support)!

---

## Building a Python package

---

```nix
python3Packages.buildPythonPackage {
  name = "<name>";
  format = "pyproject";
  src = ./path/to/sources;
  propagatedBuildInputs = with python3Packages; [
    <packages>
  ];
}
```

---

## Building packages from GitHub

We can fetch the sources from a Git repository on GitHub!

```nix
fetchFromGitHub {
  owner = "<github-user>";
  repo = "<repository-name>";
  rev = "<revision>";
  sha256 = "<sha256>";
};
```

---

For example:

```nix
{
  fetchFromGitHub,
  pkgs,
  ...
}:
with pkgs;
  python3Packages.buildPythonPackage {
    name = "ical2json";
    format = "pyproject";
    src = fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "codersonlych";
      repo = "ical2json";
      rev = "b4692550f0c3e27d9c2dd386931a5148c280f817";
      sha256 = "sha256-5b/6vkiaLvbxACSEqf322XjMr8Q7VtaZVSZ68PO2Xe8=";
    };
    propagatedBuildInputs = with python3Packages; [
      docopt
      hatchling
      icalendar
      requests
    ];
  }
```
