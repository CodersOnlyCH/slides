## This evening's goals

- Me being exposed to questions
- You learning at least something new

---

## Schedule

1. Introduction to flakes
2. Creating a flake from a template
3. Structure of a flake
4. Create your own flake from scratch
5. Adding a shell to your flake

---

## Introduction to flakes

https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes

---

## What is a flake?

[...] a standard way to write [...] packages [...] improving reproducibility

---

## The intent of flakes

- standardizing inputs
- pinning input versions
- standardizing outputs

---

## Creating flakes from a template

1. Choose a template
   https://github.com/NixOS/templates lists a bunch
2. Run
   ```shell
   $ nix flake init --template templates#trivial
   ```
3. Profit!
   ...from your newly created `flake.nix` file

---

## Using the flake

See the available packages with

```shell
$ nix flake show
path:/the/path/to/the/folder?lastModified=someunixtime&narHash=sha256-somehash
└───packages
    └───x86_64-linux
        ├───default omitted (use '--all-systems' to show)
        └───hello omitted (use '--all-systems' to show)
```

or build a package using

```shell
$ nix build .#hello
```

---

## What's the structure of a flake

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/master";
  };
  outputs = inputs: {
    apps."<system>"."<name>" = {
      type = "app";
      program = "<store-path>";
    };
    devShells."<system>"."<name>" = derivation;
    packages."<system>"."<name>" = derivation;
    templates."<name>" = {
      path = "<store-path>";
      description = "template description goes here";
    };
  };
}
```

---

## Creating a flake with a shell

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/master";
  };
  outputs = inputs @ {nixpkgs}: let
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.aarch64-darwin;
  in {
    devShells.aarch64-darwin.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      packages = with pkgs; [
        python
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

---

## Use the shell of the flake

Now you can start that shell using:

```shell
$ nix develop .#default
```

---
